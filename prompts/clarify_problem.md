# Step 1: Clarify Problem

You are analyzing a coding problem to create a clear specification for implementation.

## Input

Read the problem description from:
```
{workspace}/context/problem.txt
```

## Your Task

Analyze the problem and create a detailed clarification document that includes:

1. **Problem Summary**: One-sentence description of what needs to be solved
2. **Inputs**: What inputs the solution will receive (types, formats, constraints)
3. **Outputs**: What the solution should return (types, formats)
4. **Constraints**: Time/space complexity requirements, edge cases, limits
5. **Examples**: Work through 2-3 examples showing input→output
6. **Key Insights**: Important observations about the problem (patterns, algorithms, data structures)
7. **Edge Cases**: Special cases to handle (empty inputs, single elements, duplicates, etc.)

## Output

Write your analysis to:
```
{workspace}/context/clarified_problem.md
```

Make it clear, structured, and complete enough that someone could implement the solution just from reading your clarification.
